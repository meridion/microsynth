msynth> x = x
error: All recursive variables must be referenced with a delay
       of at least 1 sample, to break infinite feedback.
msynth> x := z
No such variable: 'z'
msynth> x := x
spec: usage 0
msynth> x:= x
spec: usage 2
spec: Cycle detected returning 1.
Assignment would cause cycle in soundgraph, use recursive variables instead

----------------

x := x should never yield spec: usage 0
